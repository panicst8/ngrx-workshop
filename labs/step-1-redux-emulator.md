## Exercise: Redux - Use a custom, redux-like Store

Redux promotes a simple one-way dataflow for applications 
where views dispatch actions, stores process actions using reducers
and then notify view listeners when the store state has changed.


## Scenario

Consider the following application where your clients can vote to increase the US Tea taxes.

Let's simulate the Redux flow patterns using stores, reducers, and dispatched actions. 
This will be a simple emulation of the Redux synchronous functionality.

The AppStore class already has the store-like methods:

```js
export class AppStore {
   dispatch(action) { /* .... */ }
   subscribe(listener) { /* .... */ }
   getState(): any { /* .... */ }
}
```

## Tasks

1. Use the following actions to increment or decrement the votes:
    *  Add the actions (below) to the `src/app/store/app-store.ts`  
    ```js
       export const VoteActions = {
         NO : "NO",
         YES : "YES"
       };
    ```
  
2. Update the **VoterComponent** to dispatch actions 
    * Dispatch VoteActions using plain objects with a `type` property   

3. Update `AppStore::reducer` to modify the store state for YES/NO actions.
    > Make sure you return a new state object instead of mutating the existing object!

4. See how the StatusComponent vote count changes as the vote buttons are clicked.
